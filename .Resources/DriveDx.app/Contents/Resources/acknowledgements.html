### AUTHORS ###
This code was originally developed as a Senior Thesis by Michael
Cornwell at the Concurrent Systems Laboratory (now part of the Storage
Systems Research Center), Jack Baskin School of Engineering, University
of California, Santa Cruz. http://ssrc.soe.ucsc.edu/

This package is meant to be an up-to-date replacement for the
ucsc-smartsuite and smartsuite packages, and is derived from that code.
